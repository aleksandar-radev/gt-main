# Privacy Experience Implementation Plan

## Objectives
- Provide a dedicated, localized privacy policy page that explains data practices clearly.
- Introduce a reusable consent mechanism that records user choices with versioning.
- Ensure the rest of the application can react to consent status for optional functionality.

## Milestones
1. **Content & Localization**
   - Draft structured privacy policy copy that covers collection, usage, sharing, user rights, contact details, and revision date.
   - Add translation keys for privacy and consent messaging to every supported locale.

2. **Routing & Navigation**
   - Create a `PrivacyPolicyView` mirroring existing static page layout conventions.
   - Register a `/privacy` route and surface navigation links in the header and footer.

3. **Consent Infrastructure**
   - Build a `CookieConsentBanner` component with accept/decline actions and a learn-more link.
   - Persist consent choices via a dedicated Pinia store that manages cookie versioning and timestamping.

4. **App Integration**
   - Mount the consent banner within `MainLayout` and hide it automatically when consent is recorded.
   - Expose helper functions so optional services (e.g., analytics) can respond to consent changes.

5. **Quality Assurance**
   - Manually verify route accessibility, localization switching, cookie persistence, and banner visibility logic.
   - Document the consent flow to keep future updates aligned with policy revisions.

## Success Criteria
- The privacy policy is reachable, localized, and visually consistent with other informational pages.
- Consent decisions are stored with version metadata and respected after refreshes.
- Declining consent prevents optional services from activating.
